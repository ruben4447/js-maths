// Reduces arguments into each other, transforming an array to a single value

let arr = 1:6;

// Find summation
println("Sum of {arr} = " + reduce(arr, (acc, curr) -> acc + curr)); // => Sum of [1,2,3,4,5] = 15

// With starting value
println("Sum of {arr} + 10 = " + reduce(arr, (acc, curr) -> acc + curr, 10)); // => Sum of [1,2,3,4,5] + 10 = 25

// Works with any types, as long as the passed function handles it correctly
